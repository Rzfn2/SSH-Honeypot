## üîç Full Code Explanation: `ssh_honeypot.py`

This script is a fake SSH server honeypot written in Python using the Paramiko library. It is designed to mimic a real Linux shell experience for attackers and log all activity for threat intelligence purposes.

---

### üì¶ Modules & Imports

```python
import logging
import socket
import paramiko
import threading
from logging.handlers import RotatingFileHandler
```

* **paramiko**: Core SSH server functionality.
* **logging**: Captures shell and login activity.
* **threading**: Allows handling multiple SSH clients concurrently.
* **socket**: Listens for SSH connections.
* **RotatingFileHandler**: Prevents log files from growing indefinitely.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration & Constants

```python
HOST_KEY = paramiko.RSAKey(filename='ssh_host_key')
BIND_ADDR = '0.0.0.0'
PORT = 2222
```

* Loads the SSH host key.
* Listens on all interfaces on port 2222.

```python
DATE_FORMAT = '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'
LOG_FORMAT = logging.Formatter(...)
```

* Sets up logging format and timestamp style.

---

### ü™µ Logging Setup

Two separate loggers:

```python
Honey_logger = logging.getLogger('Honey_logger')
Honey_logger_creds = logging.getLogger('Honey_logger_creds')
```

* `audit.log`: Tracks session activity.
* `cmd_audit.log`: Logs usernames, passwords, and shell commands.

Both use `RotatingFileHandler` to avoid uncontrolled growth.

---

### üíª Honey Shell Function

```python
def Honey_shell(channel, client_ip):
```

* Sends a welcome banner and command prompt (`Abdullah-BNR$`).
* Captures keystrokes one at a time.
* Buffers user input until `Enter` is pressed.
* Handles:

  * **Backspace**: deletes last char in buffer.
  * **Arrow keys**: ignored to avoid escape sequence clutter.
  * **Line submission**: logged and processed.

#### Fake Command Handling

```python
fake_responses = {
    "ls": "backup/  secrets.txt  logs/",
    "cat secrets.txt": "root:toor\nadmin:admin123",
    ...
}
```

* Predefined responses for specific commands.
* If the command isn't defined, returns: `bash: <cmd>: command not found`

Each response is followed by the prompt again.

---

### üîê SSH Server Logic

```python
class HoneySSHServer(paramiko.ServerInterface):
```

This class accepts and handles authentication + session requests:

* `check_channel_request`: Only allows session channels.
* `check_auth_password`: Always returns successful login and logs the credentials.
* `check_channel_shell_request`: Accepts shell sessions.
* `check_channel_pty_request`: Accepts PTY requests (needed for proper SSH client behavior).

---

### üîÅ Connection Handler

```python
def handle_connection(client, addr):
```

* Sets up SSH transport with the provided `client` socket.
* Loads the `HOST_KEY`.
* Attaches the `HoneySSHServer` class.
* Accepts and hands the connection to `Honey_shell()`.
* Cleans up the socket.

---

### üöÄ Entry Point

```python
def start_ssh_server():
```

* Binds a socket to port 2222.
* Accepts incoming connections.
* For each, launches a new thread with `handle_connection()`.

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    start_ssh_server()
```

---

### üß™ Final Behavior

* Attacker connects via SSH on port 2222.
* Any username/password is accepted.
* A fake Linux shell is shown.
* Commands like `ls`, `pwd`, `cat` are faked.
* All interaction is logged.

---

### üìå Summary

This honeypot mimics a Linux shell well enough to fool basic attackers and bots. It logs credentials and behavior for analysis, while being safe (no real shell access).

‚úÖ PTY support is enabled.
‚úÖ Echo, backspace, and newline behave normally.
‚úÖ You can enhance it by adding more fake commands or alerts.
